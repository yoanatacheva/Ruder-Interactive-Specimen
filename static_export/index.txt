Swiss Style, emerging in the 1950s, emphasized the use of sans-serif typefaces, a structured grid for page layout, and a harmonious blend of typography and photography.

It also came with a number of subtle formal changes to letterforms, most notably on ‘a’, ‘c’, ‘s’, ‘R’ and others, which made the overall appearance of the typeface more straight and more graphic. Compared to all similar shapes which were in frequent use on posters at the time, the formal rigour of Ruder’s letters is outstanding.

He made the shapes slightly more uniform and expanded the glyph set, and he transferred some outstanding features of individual letters to others: The strong diagonal to be found in ‘S’, ‘s’ and ‘2’ was adapted to the ‘a’, and the wide black junction of diagonal and stem in ‘K’ and ‘k’ was taken over for ‘X’ and ‘x’."}],["$","p",null,{"className":"block","children":"At Lineto, Pulver’s drawings were re-worked and the character set was expanded by Arve Båtevik, adhering to contemporary principles of type design which turned out to perfectly suit Ruder’s early attempts at grid-based design and modular letter-shapes.
